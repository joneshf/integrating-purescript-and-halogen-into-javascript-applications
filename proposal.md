# Integrating PureScript and Halogen into JavaScript Applications

## Introduction

PureScript is a statically-typed purely functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript. Halogen is a library for creating declarative type-safe user interfaces in PureScript. In this session we take a JavaScript application and incrementally replace parts of it with PureScript and Halogen. Along the way, we learn about static typing, interoperability between the languages and discuss trade-offs.

## Benefits

- Read and understand PureScript code.
- Understand how Halogen works.
- Incrementally replace parts of plain JavaScript with PureScript.
- Incrementally replace parts of React and Redux with Halogen.

## Concepts you will learn

- Immutable Data
- Function composition
- Hindley-Milner type system
- Algebraic Data Types
- Pattern Matching
- Parametric Polymorphism
- Row Types
- Type Classes
- Natural Transformations

## Concrete skills you will acquire

- Destructure values to access their components
- Read basic type signatures
- Use data types to represent optionality
- Solve problems without nulls, exceptions, or type casts
- Model a business domain with Algebraic Data Types 
- Reliably identify & isolate pure code from impure code
- Write imperative code in a purely functional way through monads
